# ReinforcementLearning
Code repository for my book club and work on Sutton and Barto's book by the same name.

This is my code repository for the book club that several PuPPy members are running in Seattle.  
My code is meant to be explanatory and super-easy to follow.  To put it another way, I'm getting
the job done in a way that anyone can (hopefully!) read and understand, without worrying too much about 
optimization or run-time performance.  

FYI, the Jupyter notebooks contain Julia code that I used to get my RL problems to run faster.  In case you are interested.
